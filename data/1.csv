1557.1999999228865,"<p style='text-align:left'>This study is about memory for the causes and effects regulating the production of hormones in an alien species. There are seven hormones involved:</p>
<p> YOB AUS POS KAB RUS HUS QUD</p>
<p style='text-align:left'>You will be shown sentences one at a time, each of the form ""The presence of X causes the production of Y"", where X and Y are hormones that the alien produces. For each sentence, indicate with a keypress whether you think the sentence is true. If you think that it is true, press F. If you think that it is false, press J. After you guess, you will be told whether you are correct. You will go through many sentenes this way until you successfully learn the relationships. Take your time, don't rush, and make sure to understand the sentences, as that is the best way to learn them.</p>","0","instructions","html-button-response",0,1559,"0.0-0.0","1","causal","RUS,YOB,HUS,KAB,AUS,POS,QUD",,,,,,,
