341.0950000397861,"<p style='text-align:left'>This study is about memory for social groups. There are five people involved:</p>
<p> William Lucas Oliver Benjamin James</p>
<p style='text-align:left'>Your job is to learn who influences who among these people. You will be shown sentences one at a time, each of the form ""William influences Lucas."" For each sentence, indicate with a keypress whether the sentence is true. If you think that the sentence is true, then you would press F. Otherwise, you would press J. After you guess, you will be told whether you are correct or not. You will go through many sentences in this way until you successfully learn the relationships. Take your time, donâ€™t rush, and make sure to try to understand the sentences, as that is the best way to learn.
